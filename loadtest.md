- **Server**: Gunicorn with Uvicorn Workers (4 workers)
- **Users**: 20
- **Spawn Rate**: 5 users/s
- **Duration**: 60s
- **Host**: http://localhost:8000

## Executive Summary
The system successfully completed the load test with **20 concurrent users** running on **Gunicorn**.
- **Stability**: No server crashes (500 Internal Server Error) were observed.
- **Robustness**: The application correctly handled invalid requests with appropriate 4xx client error codes.
- **Performance**: Average response times remained low (<30ms) for high-traffic endpoints.

## Error Analysis
The "failures" recorded were intentional and expected behavior for the test scenario:
| Error Code | Occurrences | Cause | Analysis |
|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| **400 Bad Request** | 136 | Duplicate answer submissions | **Pass**. The system correctly identifies and rejects duplicate submissions to enforce idempotency. |
| **404 Not Found** | 2 | Metrics for non-existent users | **Pass**. New users generated by the load test may query metrics before their first game event, correctly returning 404. |
